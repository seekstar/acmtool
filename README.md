# My acm tools

## Description

Almost all code was written by myself, but I learned from some code and ideas from others.

## overview

- Data structure: disjoint, binary indexed tree, persistent segment tree, heavy-light decomposition, splay, treap, etc.

- Graph theory: minimum spanning tree, network flow, A*, K-th shortest path, point divide and conquer, dijkstra, tarjan, LCA, etc.

- Math: linear sieve, mobius inversion, FFT, NTT, BSGS, Lagrange interpolation, Miller-Rabin, etc.

- Geometry: convex hull, intersection of half-planes, rotating calipers, slope optimization, etc.
